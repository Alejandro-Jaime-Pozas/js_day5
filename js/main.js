// // main content for weather app goes here

// Using the Open Weather API create a weather application that, at a minimum, displays the High, Low, Current and Feels Like using JavaScript.
// (Creative freedom is encouraged here)
// You will possibly need to change the weather data from Kelvin to Farenheit using this formula (Depending on the api endpoint you are accessing)
// â„‰=((K-273.15)*1.8)+32
// You can add a zip code to your project if you wish (not a strict requirement). This is shown in the walkthrough demo video as a possible outcome but again is not mandatory.
// Once the project is complete, commit the project to github and submit the github repository link to the assignment.

console.log('in main.js')
console.log(APIKey)

// displays the High, Low, Current and Feels Like using JavaScript.
// so i let a 'p' element within each of the 4 weather cards. i can do htmlinner to insert text into those elements
